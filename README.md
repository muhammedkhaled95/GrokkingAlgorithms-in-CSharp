# Grokking Algorithms Code Demos and Exercises

This repository contains all the code demos and exercises in C# from the book **"Grokking Algorithms"** by **Aditya Y. Bhargava**.

The purpose of this project is to provide practical implementations and solutions to the problems presented in the book, helping to solidify the understanding of core algorithms and data structures.

## Work in Progress

Please note that this repository is a **work in progress**. As I continue to work through the book, more demos and exercises will be added.

Feel free to contribute or review the code if you're interested in algorithms or learning alongside the book!

## Setup

To run the code on your local machine, clone the repository and follow any additional setup instructions for each demo or exercise.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/muhammedkhaled95/GrokkingAlgorithms-in-CSharp.git
cd <repo-name>
